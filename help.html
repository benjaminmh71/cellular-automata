    Use the grid width and height fields to change the size of the grid.
    The rules can be changed by the Off to On and On to Off fields. These
    field should contain the list of possible neighbour counts that turn a
    state 0 cell into a state 1 cell and a state 1 cell into a state 0 cell,
    respectively. Seperate the counts by commas. You can also use a hyphen
    to list a range of numbers.
    You'll have to reset the field for the changes to take effect.</p>
